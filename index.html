    <p>
        My Name is Ever Medina. I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona in 2017 with a degree in Business Administration.
I currently work at IDW, a commercial refrigeration company as a part of the operations team.This year i decided it was time for a career change so i enrolled in the coding bootcamp at UCR. 
My interest in coding began in the early social media days of Myspace where you were able to modify your webpage and showcase your creations to all of your friends, family and colleagues.
I feel that I am a good fit for a career in coding because I have a passion for problem solving and creating solutions. My goal after bootcamp is to become a full stack developer and be challenged every day in my role. On my free time i enjoy hiking,travel and finding new spots to eat.
I currently reside in Fontana with my wife, 2 German Shepherds and a baby on the way! I'm constantly on the move but i wouldn't have it any other way!
